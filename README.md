This repository contains a QGIS project that can be directly downloaded and opened. If you do not know how to use Git, simply go to the "Clone or download" button, press Download ZIP, unzip the project, and open the map (assuming, of course, you have QGIS on your computer).

If you know how to use Git, clone the project, and you'll be able to run ```git pull``` whenever you wish to see the newest updates (during the field project, new village surveys will be added pretty much every day).
